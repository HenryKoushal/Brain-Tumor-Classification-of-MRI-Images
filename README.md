# Brain-Tumor-Classification-of-MRI-Images
This project applies the use of machine learning  techniques for the classification of brain tumors in images  from MRI images. These images have been classified into four  types: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor.types: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. The outcomes reveal that even though conventional machinelearning algorithms are helpful to identify the characteristics of the diseases and offer beneficial diagnostic results, effective enhancement of classifying tumor types continues to be restricted compared to improved methods.
